        <h2 class="text-primary">But what is code?</h2>
        <div class="video-text-right">
            <p>Learn about what code is by watching this cool video. You might be suprised to learn that code is all around you, in your home,in your parents car, on aeroplanes, in games consoles, in space and in your classroom on the whiteboard.</p>
            <p>Just as people all around the world speak different languages, there are also many different coding languages. Depending on what you want to do, you will choose a particular language. These languages do different things. For example, you probably
                heard about Minecraft right? Well that was written in a language called Java. And this webpage that you are looking at right now uses HTML,CSS and JavaScript. If you want to control physical devices in the real world you will probably
                use a language called C/C++.

        <p> If you want to get into coding, here are some suggestions. Just hover and click on any of the sections below: </p>
        <p>
            Getting Started: Intro to Coding Video Choosing a Language Choosing a platform Choosing an editor My recommendations: Join a Dojo, then choose a language: Scratch, Processing, Python Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript), Mobile Video: Khanacademy coding resources
            or choose an editors: Scratch Offline Explorer, Notepad++, Nano, Sublime Text, Brackets, Video, Bluefish, Idle, Other Tools: Simage Editors (Gimp and InkscAPE) ???

        <p class="list-group-item-text">I have been attending Coderdojo for almost 2 years now. It's fantastic!! CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community based programming clubs for young people. At a Dojo, young people, between 7 and 17, learn how to code, develop
            websites, apps, programs, games and explore technology in an informal and creative environment. In addition to learning to code attendees meet like minded people and are exposed to the possibilities of technology.</p>
